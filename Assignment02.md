## About Usability Testing (UT)
Usability testing (UT) is an important part of the user-centered design (UCD) process and helps designers assess how easy
the user interfaces are to use. By getting feedback from users, you can change people's attitudes about the users and change
the design and development process, and ultimately increase the website's effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.


In my pilot UT, I test the website [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/) for tasks that examine whether a user can 
find information about books relating to their interests. Based on my heuristics evaluation, I found that the vocabulary
used were sometimes confusing, such as the difference between "book list" and "bookshelf," so I included tasks that use 
both functions. In addition, I found many of the buttons and links to be too small to recognize or hard to find, so I tested 
for tasks that used those small buttons, such as editing or deleting a review.

## Reflection
I think the UT went relatively smoothly, and I was able to learn a lot from the participant's feedback. The participant was able to complete the tasks given, although I could see that she was frustrated at times, which made me frustrated because I wanted to intervene and help. It was really helpful to be able to see the participant's facial expressions and see what went on in her mind as she went through the tasks, especially because a lot of the feedback she gave were new perspectives that I did not notice. For example, she was struggling to find related books to Harry Potter because the "related shelves" button was too small. I was also able to notice overlapping issues I found in my heuristics evaluation, such as an issue with too many buttons and links, making the website seem "busy," as the participant noted in the product satisfaction card. In regards to what went wrong, there was a small typo in my questionnaire, so I had to intervene to let my participant know that it was a mistake on my end. 


Next time, think I would try to make some of the tasks shorter. For example, I included a task where the user had to look for five books and put them in a bookshelf, but I realized that the task seemed too redundant. I originally included the task to just to see if the participant had trouble in distinguishing between the vocabulary "bookshelf" and "book list," so doing the same task five times was probably unnecessary and could have made the task too boring for the participant. In addition, I would like to try the UT with the mobile app version of Goodreads, to see what it is like to test an app versus a website.
