## About Usability Testing (UT)
Usability testing (UT) is an important part of the user-centered design (UCD) process and helps designers assess how easy
the user interfaces are to use. By getting feedback from users, you can change people's attitudes about the users and change
the design and development process, and ultimately increase the website's effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.


In my pilot UT, I test the website [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/) for tasks that examine whether a user can 
find information about books relating to their interests. Based on my heuristics evaluation, I found that the vocabulary
used were sometimes confusing, such as the difference between "book list" and "bookshelf," so I included tasks that use 
both functions. In addition, I found many of the buttons and links to be too small to recognize or hard to find, so I tested 
for tasks that used those small buttons, such as editing or deleting a review.
