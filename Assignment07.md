# Assignment 7

## üìù Description of Project
* This is a high-fidelity prototype of a social media app for book readers, essentially like Goodreads, 
with some added features. My process of creating this prototype was: 
(1) referring to the [low-fidelity prototype](https://github.com/yoshinogoto/DH150-YoshinoGoto/edit/master/Assignment06.md)
and [my personas](https://github.com/yoshinogoto/DH150-YoshinoGoto/blob/master/Assignment05.md) to create the three features on Figma, 
(2) a cognitive walkthrough and impression test with three of my classmates, 
(3) 4 usability tests with my classmates, 
(4) revision, 
(5) another usability test with my family member. 
The purpose of this prototype is to create and test the three features designed based on my three personas: 
Mai, Nicole, and David, and to see if it is usable for actual users. 

## üóí A List of Tasks this Prototype Supported
1. For bookworm grandpa David: easily be able to search a book, then immediately look at the summary, 
book information, author information, purchase the book, and add it to his bookshelf.
2. For organized, social reader Nicole: sharing a book to friends through other social media apps 
such as texting and email but also within the app.
3. For the creative reader Mai: a way to keep a book log on a book you are currently reading and be able to change fonts 
and colors of your log.
