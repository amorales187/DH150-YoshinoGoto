# Redesigning the Goodreads App
## Yoshino Goto

### Introduction
With stay-at-home orders in place due to the coronavirus, I noticed people around me were 
reading more books, including me, my family, and some of my friends. I often use Goodreads, which is a social media 
website/app for bookreaders, to check out ratings of books and find recommendations. During this quarantine 
with people feeling more lonely than usual, I thought that people's book-reading experience can be greatly improved
by encouraging more conversations with others and organizing their thoughts about books they've read. 
Thus, in this project, I make some changes to the Goodreads app to make people's book-reading experience more social and 
fulfilling. 

### Clear Design Statement
The purpose of this project is to improve the app Goodreads by allowing more social 
interactions and a feature to help introspect on one's thoughts by keeping a book log. The issue is that the current
Goodreads website and app includes a lot of information that makes it difficult to navigate. By making changes to this app,
I want to help book readers interact more with other people and the book they are reading. 

### Competitor Analysis: Heuristics Evaluation 
Overall, the website Goodreads is relatively user-friendly and does its job as a place to track books users have read and want to 
read. However, the main issues with this website lie in error prevention and minimalist design. While it does provide 
good documentation for solving many of the problems users encounter, it should create a design that prevents many of these 
errors such as email addresses not being verified. In addition, the aesthetics of the website feel very cluttered and 
difficult to use, which could deter users away from using Goodreads. [...read more](https://github.com/yoshinogoto/DH150-YoshinoGoto/blob/master/Assignment01/Assignment01.md)

### Competitor Analysis: Usability Testing
Usability testing (UT) is an important part of the user-centered design (UCD) process and helps designers assess how easy 
the user interfaces are to use. By getting feedback from users, you can change people's attitudes about the users and 
change the design and development process, and ultimately increase the website's effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
In my pilot UT, I test the website Goodreads for tasks that examine whether a user can find information about books 
relating to their interests. [...read more](https://github.com/yoshinogoto/DH150-YoshinoGoto/blob/master/Assignment02/Assignment02.md)

### User research
I decided to use a combination of two methods: participatory observation and interview.
For participatory observation, I observed 2 activities: logging a book by hand and finding a book to read in the Amazon 
Kindle store. [...read more](https://github.com/yoshinogoto/DH150-YoshinoGoto/blob/master/Assignment04/Assignment04.md)

### UX storytelling
The purpose of UX storytelling is to shift your perspective to the user's perspective and see the world how they would 
see it. Creating personas and their story lets you and your team share the same image of the users. Storytelling also helps
filter out any biases you or your interviewees had and focus solely on the users. [...read more](https://github.com/yoshinogoto/DH150-YoshinoGoto/blob/master/Assignment05/Assignment05.md)

### Wireframe and graphic design element variation
I want to create an app that allows people to find, share, and track books they have read, 
based on the social book cataloging site/app Goodreads. My ultimate goal is to make reading books more 
fun through creating a community of readers. [...read more](https://github.com/yoshinogoto/DH150-YoshinoGoto/blob/master/Assignment06/Assignment06.md)

### Low-fidelity prototype 
The purpose of this low-fidelity prototype is to see whether the features I came up with work for a user. 
I want to see if the user can navigate through the features and flow I created. 
I also want to detect any major problems with the features, as well as any additional features the user wants to see, 
and objectively see what I have made so far by looking at how a user interacts with it. [...read more](https://github.com/yoshinogoto/DH150-YoshinoGoto/blob/master/Assignment06/Assignment06.md)

### High-fidelity prototype 
This is a high-fidelity prototype of a social media app for book readers, essentially like Goodreads, 
with some added features. My process of creating this prototype was: 
(1) referring to the low-fidelity prototype and my personas to create the three features on Figma, 
(2) a cognitive walkthrough and impression test with three of my classmates, 
(3) 4 usability tests with my classmates, 
(4) revision. The purpose of this prototype is to create and test the three features designed based on my three personas: 
Mai, Nicole, and David, and to see if it is usable for actual users. [...read more](https://github.com/yoshinogoto/DH150-YoshinoGoto/blob/master/Assignment07.md)

### Evaluation and Revision History 
I conducted four usability tests among my classmates for an evaluation of my design. 
These usability tests were conducted over Zoom and with the permission of the participants, their screen and facial 
expressions were recorded. [...read more](https://github.com/yoshinogoto/DH150-YoshinoGoto/blob/master/Assignment07.md)

### Conclusion: what did you learn throughout the process?
Overall, I think I was able to reach my goal of making an app that meets the needs of my three personas. I was able to make revisions after my usability tests, and I was able to experience the process of iterative design first-hand. This was my first time going through a full iterative design process, so I really learned the importance of listening to the users. 


At first, I wanted to create a completely new app unrelated to Goodreads, but as I did more research, I noticed how hard it is to come up with a completely new app from scratch. Thus, I decided to build on the basic structure that Goodreads had. However, next time, I think I would like to create a new app. I would also do more field research and interviews to make sure the product I am making is actually reflective of a larger population. After conducting my usability tests for my high-fidelity prototype, participants said they are least likely to use the “book log” feature out of the 3 features I tested. Although I made my revisions after all of the tests were conducted, I think I would also have made changes to the design after each usability test. This would let me test through more designs and keep improving it after each test.
