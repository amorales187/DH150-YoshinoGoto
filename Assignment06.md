# Assignment 6

## üìù Description of Project
* I want to create an app that allows people to find, share, and track books they have read, 
based on the social book cataloging site/app Goodreads. My ultimate goal is to make reading books more fun 
through creating a community of readers. 
* What I have researched so far:

  * Based on my heuristics evaluation, I found that the Goodreads website had issues in error prevention and minimalist design.
There were too many buttons and links, making the website feel cluttered. Error prevention was also an issue; 
I could not complete a task because my email was not verified. 
I want to keep these issues from the website in mind when creating a low-fidelity prototype for the app.

  * In my usability testing, I found that minimal design was also an issue, 
because the user had a hard time finding a link because there were too many buttons and links on the website.

  * In my user research and contextual interview, I found that book logs function as not just a place to record books, 
but also a creative outlet. Another motivation for keeping track of books was to share and recommend it with other people. 

* 3 Personas

  From the above findings, I created three personas: 
  * Mai, an aspiring pediatrician who wants to creatively log books to show to her patients
  * Nicole, an organized and social reader who wants to share books with her friends
  * David, who wants a simple app to find and share books with his grandchildren. 
  
  (please see [here](https://github.com/yoshinogoto/DH150-YoshinoGoto/blob/master/Assignment05.md) 
  to meet these 3 cool people!)
  
* 3 Features

  Based on the personas, I came up with 3 features they could find useful:
  * Simple flow and showing where they are in a particular process for people like David. 
  I tried to keep each screen as simple as possible and let users know where they are in a certain process, 
  like logging a book or looking at an overview of the book. 
  * A share button for a user like Nicole, where she can share any book through SMS, email, Facebook, 
  and other social media websites, or directly through friends she connects with on the app and send a message.
  * A book log button where a user like Mai can log books in a creative way. 
  She can change the font, change colors, and bold/italicize selected parts.

* Purpose of Low-fidelity Prototype
  * See whether the features I came up with work for a user. 
  I want to see if the user can navigate through the features and flow I created.
  * Detect any major problems with the features, as well as any additional features the user wants to see.
  * Objectively see what I have made so far by looking at how a user interacts with it.


## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Tasks This Prototype Will Support
1. Search *Pachinko* by title from home screen and add it to ‚Äúwant to read‚Äù shelf
2. Look at the overview of *Pachinko* and share it to Ashley, your friend who also uses the app
3. Write a book log and publish it to the public

## üîç Reflection
* What went smoothly: 

  * Task 1: The participant was able to smoothly get from the home screen to the search bar, then searching the book title, and getting to the book overview.
  * Task 2: Although it took a little longer than expected, the participant was able to get from the ‚Äúshare‚Äù button and find the person to send it to. 
  * Task 3: The participant was able to complete this the most smoothly. She also mentioned that she liked the option to be able to limit who to share the book logs to.
 
* What went wrong: 

  * Task 1: The participant was confused about where some of the arrows go and could not find the button that goes to selecting a bookshelf.
  * Task 2: The participant was confused about where the arrows go, which is why it took longer than expected to complete the task. She also wondered whether a book could be sent to multiple people at once.
  * Task 3: After completing the book log, the participant did not know how to get back to the home screen. She also mentioned some features she wanted to see, such as: (1) being able to see time spent reading, (2) being able to buy books through the app, (3) friends being able to see your favorite books and recommendations, (4) being able to see friends‚Äô reactions to a book log.

* What I would change:

  Two main issues:
 
   * Flow. The participant was confused about where the arrows go for 2 out of the 3 tasks. I should make the arrows clearer and make sure there is a clear way to get back to the home screen or to the previous page in every screen. I would make the "add to shelf" button bigger, because the user had a hard time reaching to that button from the arrows I drew. I would also like to add a confirmation page for after the user has successfully added a book to a shelf, because the user seemed confused about whether there was an arrow that would lead to somewhere after adding the book to the shelf. By adding a confirmation page, the user will know that he/she has completed the desired task.  
   * More social features. The participant wanted to see if she could send a book to multiple people at once, if other people can view your profile, and if she could see friends‚Äô activities. Thus, I would add more features to connect to people.

  *side note*: I thought it was interesting to see that the participant wanted the ‚Äúlog a book‚Äù button to say ‚Äúlog for today‚Äù instead. She said that sometimes, when you are reading a long book, it may be discouraging to say ‚Äúlog a book,‚Äù because it implies you can‚Äôt log it until you finish it. Thus, ‚Äúlog for today‚Äù sounds friendlier and easier to log. She also mentioned that instead of displaying the number of friends on the profile, displaying the number of people you are following might be better. She said that if she were to follow any authors or celebrities, she would want to be able to see that. Some of these statements she made made me think about the role of UX content and how the vocabulary used in the interface could change how a user perceives his/her experience.
