# Reading Tracker App

My project of interest is a reading tracker app that allows readers to track books they have read. I want to create an app that makes it easy, fun, and accomplishing for users to read and record books they have read. 


## Website #1: Goodreads

https://www.goodreads.com/
### About Goodreads
Goodreads is a website where book readers can track books they have read, want to read, read book reviews, and share books with friends and people around the world.

### Overall Evaluation of the Website
Overall, the website is relatively user-friendly and does its job as a place to track books users have read and want to read. However, the main issues with this website lie in error prevention and minimalist design. While it does provide good documentation for solving many of the problems users encounter, it should create a design that prevents many of these errors such as email addresses not being verified. In addition, the aesthetics of the website feel very cluttered and difficult to use, which could deter users away from using Goodreads. 

### Heuristics Evaluation
1. **Visibility of system status**
* When adding a new book, instructions are unclear and does not show clear steps to the end goal. Although it marks which fields are required, it is difficult for the user to know how to fill out each piece of information about the book. The website recommends searching for books first, however, so most users would not use this function often, and thus severity rating is medium. (2)
2. **Match between system and real world**
* The website has no visible issues with this. It uses words that match real-world conventions like "bookshelf" and "group discussions" to refer to the user's list of books and discussion forums.
3. **User control and freedom**
* The website should add an easily accessible undo or edit button whenever a user posts a book review, since they could notice some mistakes after they have posted. However, this is a minor problem because the user could just go back to the review he/she wrote and edit it back. (1)
4. **Consistency and standards**
* There a lot of different words used that are hard to distinguish from each other. For example, it is hard to differentiate between the term "bookshelf," which refers to your list of books you want to read or are currently reading, and "list," which refers to a list of recommendations from other people. (2)
* It is good that the website uses conventions like highlighting a word or underlining a word when a user hovers over a clickable link, but it could be standardized to just one convention for consistency. (1)
5. **Error prevention**
* I could not manually add a book because my email address was not verified. This could be a critical problem, because it could be a major obstacle that deters users away from using the website. It should either give a link to resend an email verification, text a code to the user's mobile device, or let the user know right away after getting started to verify their email to prevent future errors. (3)
6. **Recognition rather than recall**
* The website does a good job with this. For example, when searching for a book, the website generates possible books with the word the user typed so far, so that the user can just recognize the book they are looking for.
7. **Flexibility and efficiency of use**
* Although there are many, many functions you can perform in this website, there arenâ€™t any shortcuts and even if there are any, they are very hard to discover or not documented anywhere, making it hard for any user, novice or experienced, to find them. However, shortcuts are not critical or necessary for users to use the website, so this is a problem with medium severity. (2)
8. **Aesthetic and minimalist design**
* Different fonts (serif and sans serif) are used throughout the website, and some are italicized or bolded for no apparent reason, making the website look more complicated than it is. In addition, the words are too small and don't make use of the entire screen space, causing the website to feel cluttered. These altogether make the website seem harder to use and deter users away, so I categorized it as critical. (3)
* There are unnecessary buttons, such as two search bars in one screen that search for the same thing. While it does not affect any functions the user wants to perform, it does make the website confusing. (1)
9. **Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors**
* There weren't any major issues with this. For common errors such as when I can't find a book, the website indicates the problem and suggests a solution, such as giving me a link to register a new book.
10. **Help and documentation**
* The website does a good job with its documentation. For example, when they could not generate any book recommendations for the user, they (1)tell him/her why (because the user did not rate enough books) and (2)gives a link to where the user can rate more books.
 

## App #2: Bookly

### About Bookly
Bookly is an app where users can track books they have read or are planning to read. It also allows users to track the amount of time they have read so that they can make reading a regular habit.

### Overall Evaluation of the App
The main issue of the app lies in lack of help and documentation for errors such as not being able to manually add a book. In addition, it should generate search result recommendations as the user is searching in the search bar to make it easier for the user to recognize the book they are looking for. Other than that, the app is successful in its goal of helping users track what they read and record how much they have read.

### Heuristics Evaluation
1. **Visibility of system status**
* There weren't any issues with this. For example, the app shows users how far they are in the "getting started" step and how many pages they have read in each book.
2. **Match between system and real world**
* While it uses easy-to-understand language for the most part, some of the words in the achievement section are hard to understand, such as "abecedarian" or "philomath." This could be the point as this is a reading app and the designers may have wanted to use long words to make users feel like they have achieved something big, users would not feel accomplished if they do not know what the achievement title really means. However, achievements do not serve a critical function to the app, so this would be of medium severity. (2)
3. **User control and freedom**
* When user starts a reading session, the session starts immediately without any warning or confirmation; although there is a pause button, users should have freedom to start session whenever. This is not really a major problem once the user gets used to using the app, so I put it as low severity. (1)
4. **Consistency and standards**
* The app does a good job on this. It uses key words like "session" to refer to each block of time spent reading.
5. **Error prevention**
* When adding a book, the app writes towards the bottom of the screen which fields are required, but it is too small and hard to notice, thus causing users to feel frustrated when they try to register a book but do not enter all the required fields. (2)
6. **Recognition rather than recall**
* Unlike Goodreads, possible books the user is looking for do not automatically pop up when they put something in the search bar. It would be much easier and less frustrating if the user can just recognize the book they are looking for instead of trying to recall the full title of the book. (2)
7. **Flexibility and efficiency of use**
* There are some shortcuts such as swiping instead of clicking an arrow button to go to the stats page.
* However, the app could make it more efficient for the users by making shortcuts such as quick-adding reading sessions. (1)
8. **Aesthetic and minimalist design**
* There are not a lot of issues with this, but ads for in-app purchases are sometimes unpleasing when they pop-up at the user instead of a banner. (1)
9. **Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors**
* When the user is unable to add a book, the app does not specify which part was not filled out, so it is hard for the user to recognize what his/her error was. This is a critical issue because users do not know how to fix their error. (3)
10. **Help and documentation**
* Like mentioned in #9, the app does not provide helpful documentation to recover from errors. Thus, this is a critical issue. (3)
