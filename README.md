My project of interest is a reading tracker app that allows readers to track books they have read.


## Website #1: Goodreads

### About Goodreads
Goodreads is a website where book readers can track books they have read, want to read, read book reviews, and share books with friends and people around the world.

### Overall Evaluation of the Website

### Heuristics Evaluation
1. Visibility of System Status
* When adding a new book, instructions are unclear and does not show clear steps to the end goal. Although it marks which fields are required, it is difficult for the user to know how to fill out each piece of information about the book. The website recommends searching for books first, however, so most users would not use this function often, and thus severity rating is not extremely high. (2)
2. Match between system and real world
